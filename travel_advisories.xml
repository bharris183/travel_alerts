<p>Reconsider travel to the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), due to<b> arbitrary enforcement of local laws.</b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in the Hong Kong SAR due to <b>COVID-19</b>.<b></b></p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&#8239;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level&nbsp;1&nbsp;Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for the PRC, and a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for Hong Kong, due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The PRC has resumed most business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within the PRC. &nbsp;Visit the&nbsp;Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in the PRC,&nbsp;as testing and travel requirements frequently change.</p>
<p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://hk.usconsulate.gov/covid-19-information/">Consulate General's COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please monitor the Hong Kong government&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html">website&#8239;</a>for further updates on COVID-19, as testing, transit, and travel requirements frequently change.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b></p>
<p>The PRC government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including by carrying out arbitrary and wrongful detentions and through the use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without due process of law. The PRC government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans to: &#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>compel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations,&#8239;</li>
<li>pressure family members to return to the PRC from abroad,&#8239;</li>
<li>influence PRC authorities to resolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens, and</li>
<li>gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it in a court of law.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens&nbsp;traveling or residing in the PRC, including Hong Kong, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention&nbsp;without due process of law.</p>
<p>Foreigners in the PRC, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign government personnel,&nbsp;and journalists&nbsp;from&nbsp;Western countries, have been arbitrarily interrogated and detained by PRC officials&nbsp;for&nbsp;alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has&nbsp;also&nbsp;threatened, interrogated, detained, and expelled&nbsp;U.S. citizens&nbsp;living and working in&nbsp;the PRC.</p>
<p>Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government.&#8239;</p>
<p>The PRC government does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the PRC government may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services.</p>
<p><b>XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION and TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION</b></p>
<p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uyghur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.</p>
<p><b>HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION</b></p>
<p>Since the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, the PRC unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power in Hong Kong. The PRC has demonstrated an intention to use this authority to target a broad range of activities it defines as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. PRC security forces, including the new Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in Hong Kong&nbsp;and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong judiciary.</p>
<p><b>Demonstrations:&nbsp;</b>Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. On June 30, 2020, as part of its color-coded system of warning flags, the Hong Kong police unveiled a new purple flag, which warns protesters that shouting slogans or carrying banners with an intent prohibited by the law could now bring criminal charges.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.</p>
<p><b>Propaganda:</b>&nbsp;A PRC propaganda campaign has falsely accused individuals, including U.S. citizens, of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong. In some cases, the campaign has published their personal information, resulting in threats of violence on social media.</p>
<p>Read the country information page for the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html">PRC</a>&nbsp;and for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/HongKong.html#_blank">Hong Kong</a>.</p>

<p>Do not travel to Syria due to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19,&nbsp;terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;armed conflic</b>t.</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Syria due to&nbsp;COVID-19.</p>
<p>No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited (to include accepting applications for U.S. passports and U.S. Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, as well as providing notarial services), and the U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.</p>
<p>Long standing conflict with neighboring states and porous borders have contributed to a complex and unpredictable security environment. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.</p>
<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012 and as recently as early 2019. U.S. citizens are also targets of arbitrary abduction and detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/10/2018-26680/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)</a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to U.S. civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the Government of Syria&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA&#8217;s safety assessment page. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the FAA&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.</p>

<p>Do not travel to North Korea&nbsp;due&nbsp;to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19</b> <b>and&nbsp;the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals.</b></p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;North Korea due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals cannot use a U.S. passport to travel to, in, or through North Korea without a special validation from the Department of State.</li>
<li>Special validations are granted only in very limited circumstances. More information on how to apply for the special validation is available&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/passport-for-travel-to-north-korea.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services. The North Korean government routinely delays or denies Swedish officials access to detained U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>If you receive a special validation to travel to North Korea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>

<p>Chad has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders) and business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within Chad. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://td.usembassy.gov/online-resources-on-corona-virus-covid-19/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Chad.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Violent crimes, such as armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, and muggings, have occurred in Chad.</p>

<p>There are unmapped and undocumented minefields along the borders with both Libya and Sudan.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Chad as U.S. Government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, including the Lake Chad Basin.</p>

<p>Reconsider Travel to Saudi Arabia due to <b>COVID-19</b>. Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to <b>terrorism</b> and <b>the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia lifted stay at home orders and resumed domestic transportation options and businesses operations. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://sa.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to <b>terrorism</b> and <b>armed conflict.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.</p>
<p>Regional actors hostile to Saudi Arabia have conducted destructive and sometimes lethal attacks against a variety of targets including critical infrastructure, military facilities, airports, and energy facilities throughout the country, as well as vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Riyadh, Yanbu, areas in proximity to Jeddah, the civilian airport in Abha, military installations in the south, and specific oil and gas facilities are examples of recent targets. The Islamic Republic of Iran has supplied Yemen-based Houthis and other regional proxy groups with weapons, including drones, missiles, and rockets. Houthi militants continue to plan and conduct attacks against locations in Saudi Arabia. Violence associated with Iran-supported groups represents a significant threat. U.S. citizens living and working near military bases and critical civilian infrastructure, particularly in the Eastern Province and areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations, as U.S. Mission personnel and their families are restricted from travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran, and</li>
<li>Qatif in the Eastern province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.</li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. Mission personnel and their families are not permitted to use the airport in Abha without Chief of Mission approval.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Saudi Arabia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SaudiArabia.html#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p><b>Yemen Border</b></p>
<p>Violence in Yemen has spilled over into Saudi Arabia on a number of occasions. Rebel forces in Yemen fire artillery at Saudi border towns and launch cross-border attacks against Saudi military personnel. Civilians who are near the border with Yemen are at risk.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to this area.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for the Bahamas due to COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Travelers to The Bahamas may experience travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within The Bahamas due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy&#8217;s <a href="https://bs.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/" adhocenable="false">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in The Bahamas.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> The vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama (Freeport) islands. In Nassau, exercise caution in the &#8220;Over the Hill&#8221; area (south of Shirley Street). Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault occur, but generally not in tourist areas. Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use independently operated jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.</p>

<p>Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking can occur. This type of crime is more frequent outside of Khartoum.</p>
<p>Members of known terrorist groups and individuals sympathetic to these groups in Sudan could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrations can occur with no warning. The majority of recent demonstrations in Khartoum have been peaceful.&nbsp;However, police and other security forces may intervene to disperse demonstrators, including with the use of tear gas, when protests occur near key governmental locations and/or impair freedom of movement.</p>
<p>Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas near the border with South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state. Intercommunal clashes can occur throughout the country and can result in the declaration of localized States of Emergency.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Khartoum, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization from the Sudanese government to travel outside Khartoum. The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel in Sudan to use armored vehicles for official travel.</p>

<p>UN Buffer Zone: Since 1974, the southern part of Cyrus has been under the control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part of Cyprus, administered by Turkish Cypriots, proclaimed itself the &#8220;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8221; (&#8220;TRNC&#8221;) in 1983. The United States does not recognize the &#8220;TRNC,&#8221; nor does any country other than Turkey. A buffer zone patrolled by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, separates the two sides. For U.S. citizen travelers:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enter and exit the Republic of Cyprus ONLY&nbsp;</b>at Larnaca and Paphos airports and at the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca, and Paphos. The Republic of Cyprus&nbsp;<b>does not consider</b>&nbsp;entry at Ercan Airport in the north to be a &#8220;legal&#8221; entrance into Cyprus.</li>
<li>You&nbsp;<b>cannot receive a residency permit</b>&nbsp;from the Republic of Cyprus to reside in the area north of the UN buffer zone.</li>

<p>Do not travel to Afghanistan due to <b>COVID-19,</b> <b>crime, terrorism,</b> <b>civil unrest, kidnapping, </b>and <b>armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Afghanistan due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afghanistan has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed some transportation options and business operations. Visit the Embassy&#8217;s <u>COVID-19 page</u> for more information on COVID-19 in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Travel to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe because of critical levels of kidnappings, hostage taking, suicide bombings, widespread military combat operations, landmines, and terrorist and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne, magnetic, or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide vests, and grenades.</p>
<p>Terrorist and insurgent groups continue planning and executing attacks in Afghanistan. These attacks occur with little or no warning, and have targeted official Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities, local government buildings, foreign embassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental organization (NGO) offices, hospitals, residential compounds, tourist locations, transportation hubs, public gatherings, markets and shopping areas, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, universities, airports, schools, gymnasiums, and other locations frequented by U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly outside of Kabul. Evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and the volatile security situation.</p>
<p>Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Afghanistan. Unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the Department of State. U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to all locations in Kabul except the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities unless there is a compelling U.S. government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk. Additional security measures are needed for any U.S. government employee travel and movement through Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Consider signing a power of attorney.</li>
<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Carry a communication device and, where possible, ride in armored vehicles.</li>
<li>Notify a trusted person of your travel itinerary and contact information. Avoid discussing your movement plans in public where you can be overheard or with persons who do not have the need to know.</li>
<li>Obtain <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html">medical evacuation insurance</a> with a company that operates in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as an evacuation point.</li>

<p>Travelers to Brazil may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Brazil due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy&#8217;s <a href="https://br.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Brazil.</p>

<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Azerbaijan due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed some transportation options and business operations.&nbsp; Visit the Embassy's&#8239;COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has a longstanding risk presented by terrorist groups, who continue plotting possible attacks in Azerbaijan. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.&#8239;</p>
<p><b>Do not travel to:</b></p>
<p>The&#8239;<b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b>&#8239;region due to&#8239;<b>armed conflict.</b></p>
<p>Casualties continue to occur in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Intermittent&#8239;gunfire and occasional use of&#8239;artillery systems,&#8239;including&#8239;land mines and mortars, result in deaths&#8239;and&#8239;injuries&#8239;each year. Avoid roads near the &#8216;line of contact&#8217; and roads near the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Nagorno-Karabakh as U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling there.

<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Chile due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><i></i></p>
<p>Travelers to Chile may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Chile due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy's <u><a adhocenable="false" href="https://cl.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a></u> for more information on COVID-19 in Chile.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in Chile due to <b>civil unrest</b>. Read the entire Travel Advisory and Travel Alerts.</p>
<p>There have been large-scale demonstrations in Santiago and other major cities in Chile.&nbsp; Demonstrations can take place with little or no notice.&nbsp; Many protests occur with little regard for public safety, and have resulted in property damage, looting, arson, and transportation disruptions.&nbsp; Local authorities have used water cannons and tear gas to disrupt protests.</p>
<p>The government-imposed State of Emergency was lifted on October 28, 2019.&nbsp; The State of Emergency included curfews in multiple cities, which were enforced by police and the armed forces. While the State of Emergency was lifted, there continue to be conflicts between protestors and Chilean police in Santiago and other cities in Chile. You should remain vigilant, monitor local media for updates and avoid protests and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Expect disruptions to transportation, particularly in Santiago. The Santiago Metro is operating with limited hours, and service has yet to be restored to the entire network. Road blockages on highways and major thoroughfares may occur with little warning. You should contact your airline prior to travel for any information on potential flight delays.</p>
<p>Many shopping malls, banks, supermarkets, and restaurants may be operating with reduced working hours, particularly in the evening.</p>

<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&#8239;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level&nbsp;1&nbsp;Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for the PRC, and a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for Hong Kong, due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The PRC has resumed most business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within the PRC. Visit the&nbsp;Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in the PRC,&nbsp;as testing and travel requirements frequently change.</p>
<p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://hk.usconsulate.gov/covid-19-information/">Consulate General's COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please monitor the Hong Kong government&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102465.html">website&#8239;</a>for further updates on COVID-19, as testing, transit, and travel requirements frequently change.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b></p>
<p>The PRC government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including by carrying out arbitrary and wrongful detentions and through the use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without due process of law. The PRC government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans to: &#8239;</p>
<ul>
<li>compel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations,&#8239;</li>
<li>pressure family members to return to the PRC from abroad,&#8239;</li>
<li>influence PRC authorities to resolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens, and</li>
<li>gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it in a court of law.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens&nbsp;traveling or residing in the PRC, including Hong Kong, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention&nbsp;without due process of law.</p>
<p>Foreigners in the PRC, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign government personnel,&nbsp;and journalists&nbsp;from&nbsp;Western countries, have been arbitrarily interrogated and detained by PRC officials&nbsp;for&nbsp;alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has&nbsp;also&nbsp;threatened, interrogated, detained, and expelled&nbsp;U.S. citizens&nbsp;living and working in&nbsp;the PRC.</p>
<p>Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government.&#8239;</p>
<p>The PRC government does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the PRC government may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services.</p>
<p><b>XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION and TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION</b></p>
<p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uyghur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.</p>
<p><b>HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION</b></p>
<p>Since the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, the PRC unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power in Hong Kong. The PRC has demonstrated an intention to use this authority to target a broad range of activities it defines as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. PRC security forces, including the new Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in Hong Kong&nbsp;and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong judiciary.</p>
<p><b>Demonstrations:&nbsp;</b>Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. On June 30, 2020, as part of its color-coded system of warning flags, the Hong Kong police unveiled a new purple flag, which warns protesters that shouting slogans or carrying banners with an intent prohibited by the law could now bring criminal charges.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.</p>
<p><b>Propaganda:</b>&nbsp;A PRC propaganda campaign has falsely accused individuals, including U.S. citizens, of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong. In some cases, the campaign has published their personal information, resulting in threats of violence on social media.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to <b>COVID-19.&nbsp; </b>Exercise increased caution in Bangladesh due to <b>crime,</b> <b>terrorism, and kidnapping.</b></p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bangladesh due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bangladesh has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed some transportation options, and businesses operations. &nbsp;Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://bd.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Bangladesh.</p>
<p><b>Exercise increased caution in Bangladesh due to crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.</b></p>
<p>In Bangladesh the crime rate impacting foreigners is generally low. However, travelers should be aware of petty crimes such as pickpocketing in crowded areas. Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh&#8217;s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality. These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.</p>
<p>Terrorism events can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities.</p>
<p>Because of security concerns U.S. government employees in Bangladesh are subject to movement and travel restrictions. The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.</p>
<p><b>Reconsider travel to southeast Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Hill Tracts, due to crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.</b></p>
<p>Travel is dangerous to the Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to occasional communal violence and other security risks. Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas.&nbsp; Please visit our website for information on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</p>
<p>Please consult the State Department&#8217;s <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bangladesh.html">country information page</a>. If you decide to travel to Bangladesh:</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for Ghana due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ghana currently allows air transportation, and businesses are operating. Visit the <a href="https://gh.usembassy.gov/ghana-covid-19-information/">Embassy's COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Ghana.</p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban areas due to <b>crime.</b></li>
<li>Intercity highways after dark due to <b>crime.</b></li>
<li>Areas near the northern border in the Upper East and Upper West regions due to <b>crime.</b></li>
<li>Parts of the Bono East, Bono, Savannah, Northern, North East, and Upper East regions due to <b>civil unrest.</b></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><b>Urban Areas &#8211; Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>Violent crime, such as street mugging, is more frequent in urban areas as compared to their surrounding suburbs. These crimes are also more prevalent at night and in isolated locations.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.</p>
<p><b>Intercity Highways After Dark &#8211; Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>Armed assaults on private vehicles and public transports occur more frequently after dark, often by criminal elements using blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Areas Near the Northern Border in the Upper East and Upper West Regions &#8211; Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>

<p>Do not travel to Somalia due to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19,&nbsp;crime,&nbsp;terrorism,&nbsp;civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>piracy</b>.</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a level&#8239;4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Somalia due to&nbsp;COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>Somalia has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations) and business operations (including&nbsp;schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within Somalia. Visit the Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://so.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19&nbsp;page</a>&nbsp;for more information on&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;in Somalia.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland. Illegal roadblocks are also widespread. A number of schools acting as &#8220;cultural rehabilitation&#8221; facilities are operating throughout Somalia with unknown licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse and people being held against their will in these facilities are common.</p>
<p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may conduct attacks with little or no warning, targeting airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other areas where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, as well as government, military, and Western convoys. Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and mortar fire, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil unrest occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.</p>
<p>Medical facilities across Somalia have limited capacity and are often nonexistent in rural areas.</p>
<p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of permanent consular presence in Somalia.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation. For more information,&nbsp;U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;the&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions,&nbsp;and Notices.</p>

<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization&nbsp;(if you&nbsp;are traveling on business),&nbsp;so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

<p>Do not travel to South Sudan due to <b>COVID-19, crime, kidnapping, </b>and <b>armed conflict.</b></p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;South Sudan due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Travelers to South Sudan may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within South Sudan due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://ss.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in South Sudan.<b></b></p>
<p>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.</p>
<p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.</li>
<li>Avoid travel along border areas.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.</li>

<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.</li>
<li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>
<li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.</li>

<p>Do not travel to Russia due to <b>COVID-19</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>,&nbsp;<b>harassment,</b>&nbsp;<b>and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19&nbsp;page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you&nbsp;plan any international&nbsp;travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Russia a due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Travelers to Russia may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Russia due to COVID-19. Visit the <a href="https://ru.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/?_ga=2.180721391.957172912.1593033470-1973929210.1593033470">Embassy's&nbsp;COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Russia.</p>
<p>Do Not Travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;risk of civil unrest</b>.</li>
<li>Crimea due to Russia&#8217;s occupation of the Ukrainian territory<b>&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;abuses by its occupying authorities</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. government and military personnel, who are visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. For this reason, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow has advised all U.S. government and Department of Defense personnel to consider carefully travel to Russia. Russian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. citizens. Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce the law against U.S. citizen religious workers and open questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity.</p>
<p>Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Russia nationals&#8217; U.S. citizenship, including denying U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals, and preventing their departure from Russia.</p>
<p>Due to the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the U.S. government may have delayed ability to provide services to U.S. citizens, especially in the Saint Petersburg area.</p>

<p><b>North Caucasus (including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus) &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Terrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom. There have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGBTI persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to climb Mount Elbrus, as travelers must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in the North Caucasus region, including Mount Elbrus, as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the region.</p>

<p><b>Crimea &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea.

<p>Reconsider travel to Democratic Republic of the Congo due to <b>COVID-19,</b> <b>crime, </b>and<b> civil unrest.</b>&nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19&nbsp;page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you&nbsp;plan any international&nbsp;travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Democratic Republic of the Congo due to COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders) and business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within Democratic Republic of the Congo. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://cd.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p><b>Do Not Travel To</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Kivu and Ituri provinces due to <b>terrorism</b>.</li>
<li>The eastern DRC region and the three Kasai provinces (Kasai, Kasai-Oriental, Kasai-Central) due to <b>crime</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, <b>armed conflict</b> and<b> kidnapping</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, armed home invasion, and assault, is common and local police lack resources to respond effectively to serious crime. Assailants may pose as police or security agents.</p>
<p>Demonstrations are common in many cities and some have turned violent. Police have at times responded with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security conditions.</p>

<title>Worldwide Caution - Caution</title><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html</guid><category domain='Threat-Level'>Caution</category><category domain='Country-Tag'>caution</category>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>This latest update to the Department of State&#8217;s Worldwide Caution provides U.S. citizens with general information regarding terrorist activities, political violence and criminal activity that transpire abroad, as well as specific recommendations on how to prepare for possible contingencies, receive information on breaking security events and ensure that travelers can be contacted in an emergency. This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 2, 2018.</p>
<p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories</a>&nbsp;and information pages on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html">travel.state.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate you in an emergency. The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&nbsp;<b>1 (888) 407-4747</b>&nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&nbsp;<b>1 (202) 501-4444</b>&nbsp;from other countries.</p>
<p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)</li>
<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants</li>
<li>places of worship</li>
<li>schools</li>
<li>parks</li>
<li>shopping malls and markets</li>
<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites</li>
<li>public transportation systems</li>
<li>airports</li>
</ul>
<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.</p>
<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to COVID-19, limited healthcare availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws. Exercise increased caution in Nicaragua due to crime.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Nicaragua due to COVID-19. Travelers should expect delays returning to the U.S. and there is reduced availability of flights. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-2-2/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>The government of Nicaragua arbitrarily enforces laws for political purposes. Throughout Nicaragua, government officials and law enforcement continue to target those opposed to the rule of President Ortega. The government and its affiliated groups have been reported to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematically target opposition figures (regardless of nationality), including former allies, political activists, business representatives, clergy, human rights advocates, and members of the press.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily detain pro-democracy advocates.</li>
<li>Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land for political reasons.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily seize and/or search private property including personal phones and computers for anti-government content.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily detain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime for political motives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Travelers should exercise increased caution and be alert to the risks of crime, including violent crimes such as sexual assault and armed robbery.</p>
<p>Poor infrastructure in parts of the country limits the Embassy&#8217;s ability to assist U.S. citizens in emergencies. U.S. government personnel may be subject to restrictions on their movements at any time.</p>

<p><b>Phnom Penh</b></p>
<p>Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. We urge all travelers to be aware of their surroundings at all time and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like jewelry, bags and cell phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against foreigners.</p>
<p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night.</p>
<p><b>Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces</b></p>
<p>Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in very remote areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces.</p>
<p>Do not touch unknown metal objects; instead notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Use a local guide when walking in forested areas or dry rice paddies in these areas.</p>

Visit the Embassy's <a adhocenable="false" href="https://do.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in the Dominican Republic.<b></b></p>
<p>Exercise increased caution in the Dominican Republic due to<b> crime.</b></p>
<p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide and sexual assault is a concern throughout the Dominican Republic. The development of a professional tourist police corps, institution of a 911 system in many parts of the country, and a concentration of resources in resort areas means these tend to be better policed than urban areas like Santo Domingo. The wide availability of weapons, the use and trade of illicit drugs, and a weak criminal justice system contribute to the high level of criminality on the broader scale.</p>

<p>Exercise increased caution in Papua New Guinea due to <b>COVID-19</b>, <b>crime, civil unrest, health concerns, natural disasters, and kidnapping</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 1 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Papua New Guinea due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has lifted stay at home orders and resumed some transportation options and business operations. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://pg.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Reconsider travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bougainville, particularly areas near the Panguna mine, due to <b>civil unrest</b>.</li>
<li>The Highlands region due to the long-term effects of a <b>natural disaster</b> that occurred in February 2018 and <b>civil unrest</b>.</li>
<li>Areas in the vicinity of Mt. Ulawun on the island of New Britain due to <b>natural disaster</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Violent crime, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies, is common. Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violence at any time without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.</p>
<p>Public demonstrations, especially in population centers, are common and may turn violent. Even peaceful demonstrations may present opportunities for criminal elements or other actors to exacerbate local political tensions.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including Bougainville.</p>

<p>Kidnapping and hostage taking is a threat throughout the country. On May 10, 2019 a hostage rescue operation freed four international hostages that had been kidnapped in Burkina Faso and in neighboring Benin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government of Burkina Faso has maintained a state of emergency in the entire East and Sahel regions, the provinces of Kossi and Sourou in the Boucle de Mouhoun region, the province of Kenedougou in the Hauts Bassins region, the province of Loroum in the North region, and the province of Koulpelogo in the Center-East region.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout most of the country, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from travelling to regions outside the capital due to security concerns. The U.S. Embassy prohibits U.S. government personnel from personal travel to the Karpala, Balkiui and Rayongo (also known as Dayongo) neighborhoods of Ouagadougou&#8217;s Arrondissement 11 due to the potential for security operations.</p>
<p>Family members under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burkina Faso.</p>

<p>Visit the Embassy&#8217;s&nbsp;<u>COVID-19 page </u>for more information on COVID-19 in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorist groups and lone-wolf terrorists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Violence can occur in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza without warning. There has been a marked increase in demonstrations throughout Israel, some with little or no warning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>West Bank:</b>&nbsp;U.S. government travel throughout the West Bank is extremely limited. Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gaza:&#8239;&#8239;</b>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there&nbsp;and are restricted from traveling close to the Gaza demarcation line.&nbsp;&#8239;Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, controls the security infrastructure in Gaza. The security environment within Gaza and on its borders is dangerous and volatile. Sporadic mortar or rocket fire and corresponding Israeli military responses may occur at any time. During periods of unrest&nbsp;or armed conflict, the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt may be closed.</p>

<p>Do not travel to Iraq due to<b> COVID-19, terrorism</b>, <b>kidnapping</b>, <b>armed conflict, and Mission Iraq&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Iraq due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travelers to Iraq may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Iraq due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.</p>
<p>On March 25, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of designated U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the Baghdad Diplomatic support Center, and the U.S. Consulate General in Erbil due to security conditions and restricted travel options as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 31, 2019, the Embassy suspended public consular services, until further notice, as a result of damage done by Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the Embassy compound. U.S. Consulate General Erbil remains open and continues to provide consular services. On October 18, 2018, the Department of State ordered the suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. That institution has not reopened. Due to security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel in Baghdad have been instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of, or supporting designated terrorist organizations, is a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Do not travel to Yemen due to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19,&nbsp;terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict</b>, and<b>&nbsp;landmines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Yemen&nbsp;due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Sana&#8217;a suspended its operations in February 2015, and the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.</p>
<p>Military conflict has caused significant destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.</p>
<p>Cholera is present throughout Yemen. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.</p>
<p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping, and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual national Yemeni-Americans. Rebel groups in Sana&#8217;a have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty &#8211; including lengthy delays &#8211; when attempting to depart Yemen.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.</li>

<p>Reconsider travel to Mozambique due to <b>COVID-19. </b>Exercise increased caution in Mozambique due to <b>health issues</b>, <b>crime</b>, and <b>terrorism</b>. Some areas have&nbsp;greater&nbsp;risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Mozambique due to COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mozambique has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed some transportation options and business operations. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://mz.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Mozambique.</p>
<p>Do Not Travel To:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some northern districts in Cabo Delgado Province due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reconsider Travel To:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pemba, the provincial capital of Cabo Delgado, due to <b>threat of terrorism.</b></li>
<li>Some sections of the EN1 and EN6 in Sofala and Manica provinces due to&nbsp;<b>crime.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Violent crime, such as mugging, is common.</p>
<p>Mozambique&#8217;s&nbsp;health&nbsp;infrastructure is&nbsp;limited: there are only three doctors per 100,000 people, frontline health providers are often poorly trained, and medicine shortages are common. More than 1.2 million&nbsp;people in&nbsp;Mozambique have HIV/AIDS, representing a&nbsp;sizable population with compromised immune systems. In the event of a&nbsp;public health emergency, access to an ICU&nbsp;and ventilator&nbsp;support&nbsp;is highly unlikely. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Crime, including petty theft, carjackings, muggings, assaults, and violent crime, is a concern in Peru, and can occur during daylight hours, despite the presence of many witnesses.

<p>Reconsider travel to Egypt due to <b>COVID-19. </b>Exercise increased caution<b> </b>in Egypt due to <b>terrorism </b>and <b>the Embassy&#8217;s limited ability to assist dual national U.S.-Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained.</b></p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Egypt due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Egypt has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed some transportation options and business operations. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://eg.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Egypt.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sinai Peninsula (with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) due to <b>terrorism.</b></li>
<li>The Western Desert due to <b>terrorism</b>.</li>
<li>Egyptian border areas due to <b>military zones.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Egypt. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites, to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Egypt, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy may have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens. Egyptian law considers dual citizens to be Egyptian citizens.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Egypt.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Egypt:</p>

<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Sinai Peninsula - Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>The Sinai Peninsula remains a particularly dangerous area, with frequent attacks on security forces and civilians.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens anywhere in the Sinai Peninsula as U.S. government employees are not authorized to travel to these areas (with the exception of the beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh; travel to Sharm El-Sheikh is only permitted by air).</p>

<p>Do not travel to Haiti due to&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;crime,&nbsp;civil unrest, kidnapping, </b>and<b>&nbsp;COVID-19</b>.</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Haiti due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>Travelers to Haiti may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures, and other emergency conditions within Haiti due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://ht.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Haiti.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is common. Kidnapping is widespread. Kidnappers may use sophisticated planning or take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Victims have included U.S. citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Emergency response, including ambulance service, is limited or non-existent.</p>
<p>Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. The U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport. Robbers and carjackers have attacked private vehicles stuck in heavy traffic congestion and often target lone drivers, particularly women driving alone.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in some areas of Haiti. U.S. government personnel are discouraged from walking in most neighborhoods. Only adult family members over the age of 18 are permitted to accompany U.S. government employees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are prohibited from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting establishments after dark without secure, on-site parking;</li>
<li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis;</li>
<li>Visiting banks and using ATMs;</li>
<li>Driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night;</li>
<li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.</li>
<li>Visiting certain parts of the city at any time without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reconsider travel to Burundi due to <b>COVID-19</b>, <b>crime</b>, <b>health</b>, and <b>political</b> <b>violence</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Burundi due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burundi has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders) and business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within Burundi. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://bi.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Burundi.</p>
<p>Violent crimes, such as grenade attacks and armed robbery, occur frequently. Though Westerners are unlikely to be targeted, the risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is high. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to crimes.</p>
<p>Medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards, and there are no adequate trauma services in the country. Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. The CDC has also issued a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/malaria-burundi">Level 1 Travel Notice on Malaria in Burundi</a>.</p>
<p>There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi, causing sporadic violence throughout the country. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict freedom of movement. Police have conducted weapon searches in the homes of private citizens. In the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, as well as Mutimbuzi commune in Bujumbura Rural province, there have been armed attacks primarily conducted by groups operating from the eastern DRC. The border may close without notice.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi. U.S. Embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. These restrictions include limitations on all travel during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and require prior approval for travel outside of the Bujumbura Mairie Central area. The former Central Market located on Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagasore is off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel at all times, due to high rates of crime. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to travel restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, Kibira National Park (including the park&#8217;s southernmost part in Muramvya province), and Ruvubu and Buriri Forest. Embassy personnel are also prohibited from transiting through Kibira National Park to reach Kayanza via the RN-10.</p>

<li>Obtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation.</li>
<li>Avoid areas where there are large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, and exercise caution in the vicinity of any such gatherings.</li>
<li>Remain aware of your surroundings and be vigilant when traveling in unfamiliar areas or outside of cities and along border areas; take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.</li>
<li>Consider traveling in pairs and using convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the risks related to traveling outside of Bujumbura. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Include a satellite phone, map, navigation equipment, and first aid kit. Service stations are scarce in rural areas.

<p>Violent crime and gang activity are common. The vast majority of homicides are targeted assassinations against members of criminal organizations.

Bystanders have been injured or killed in shooting incidents.</p>
<p>U.S. government employees may only travel to the following locations within the state of Chihuahua and with the noted restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ciudad Juarez:</b> They may travel at any time to the area of Ciudad Juarez bounded to the east by Bulevar Independencia; to the south by De los Montes Urales/Avenida Manuel J Clouthier/Carretera de Juarez; to the west by Via Juan Gabriel/Avenida de los Insurgentes/Calle Miguel Ahumada/Francisco Javier Mina/Melchor Ochampo; and to the north by the U.S.-Mexico border.<b></b></li>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to <b>COVID-19, terrorism, and sectarian violence</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 3 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Pakistan due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Government of Pakistan has lifted stay-at-home orders and allowed the resumption of intercity domestic travel and mass transit services in most cities. Travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, business closures, and other restrictions can be reintroduced at any time within Pakistan due to COVID-19. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://pk.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page </a>for more information on COVID-19 in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to <b>terrorism </b>and <b>kidnapping.<br>
 <br>
 </b></li>
<li>The immediate vicinity of the Line of Control due to <b>terrorism </b>and<b> the potential for armed conflict.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks continue to happen across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KPK, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s security environment has improved since 2014 when Pakistani security forces undertook concerted counter terrorist and counter militant operations. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks are rare in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Pakistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Pakistan.html">country information page</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Balochistan Province &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Balochistan province. Active terrorist groups, an active separatist movement, sectarian conflicts, and deadly terrorist attacks against civilians, government offices, and security forces destabilize the province, including all major cities. In 2019, several bombings occurred in Balochistan province that resulted in injuries and deaths.</p>

<p><b>KPK Province, including the former FATA &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to KPK province, which includes the former FATA. Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government offices, and security forces. These groups historically have not discriminated between government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams.</p>

<p><b>Vicinity of Line of Control &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to the India-Pakistan border. Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. Indian and Pakistani military forces periodically exchange gunfire and artillery fire across the Line of Control (LoC). The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India. Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border.</p>

<p>Do not travel to Venezuela due to <b>crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens, </b>and <b>COVID-19</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;U.S. Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Venezuela due to COVID-19 and a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Venezuela due to Health Infrastructure Breakdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit the Venezuela Affairs Unit's <a href="https://ve.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19</a> page for more information on COVID-19 in Venezuela.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;On March 11, 2019, the U.S. Department of State announced the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas. All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon as safely possible and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is common. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets against participants and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism. The <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/FFMV/Pages/Index.aspx">United Nations Human Rights Council&#8217;s Fact-Finding Mission</a> reported that the regime has engaged in thousands of extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p>There are shortages of food, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout much of Venezuela. The CDC issued a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/health-infrastructure-breakdown-venezuela">Level 3 &#8216;Avoid Nonessential Travel&#8217;</a> notice on May 15, 2018 due to inadequate healthcare and the breakdown of the medical infrastructure in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Consular access to detained U.S. citizens is severely restricted and the U.S. government is highly unlikely to be granted access. Security forces have arbitrarily detained U.S. citizens for long periods. Venezuelan authorities may not notify the U.S. government of the detention of a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Belize due to <b>COVID-19</b>.<b> </b>Exercise increased caution in Belize due to<b> crime</b>. Some areas have increased risk.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for Belize due to COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Limited transportation options are available, and some businesses are operating, usually with significant restrictions. Quarantine measures or entry restrictions are in place for certain U.S. citizen travelers. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://bz.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Belize.</p>
<p>Violent crime &#8211; such as sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder &#8211; are common even during daylight hours and in tourist areas. A significant portion of violent crime is gang related. Due to high crime, travelers are advised to exercise caution while traveling to the south side of Belize City. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Most crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Belize City- Reconsider Travel</b></p>
<p>U.S. citizens should avoid traveling to Belize City. Historically much of the violent crime in Belize occurs in the Southside of Belize City and is gang related. This area (south of Haulover Creek Canal and continuing south to Fabers Road) does not overlap the typical tourism areas. &nbsp;All visitors should maintain an elevated level of due diligence and reduce their exposure to crime-related risks by practicing good safety and security practices. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Reconsider travel Lebanon due to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19</b>,&nbsp;<b>crime,</b>&nbsp;<b>terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest and Embassy Beirut&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;has issued a level&#8239;4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Lebanon due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>Lebanon has resumed most transportation options&nbsp;(including airport operations&nbsp;) and business operations. Other improved conditions have been reported within Lebanon. Visit the Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://lb.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19 in Lebanon.</p>
<p>On June 15, 2020, the Department of State ended its ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and eligible family members which had been in effect since March 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do Not Travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the border with Syria due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>&nbsp;<b>and</b>&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b></li>
<li>the border with Israel due to&nbsp;<b>the potential for</b>&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b></li>
<li>refugee settlements due to&nbsp;<b>the potential for</b>&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b></li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. citizens should reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas in Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, especially near Lebanon&#8217;s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions.&nbsp;Movements have been limited further by health and safety precautions related to COVID-19. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. The potential exists for death or injury in Lebanon because of the attacks and bombings perpetrated by terrorist groups. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>
<p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Armed clashes have occurred along the Lebanese borders, in Beirut, and in refugee settlements. The Lebanese Armed Forces have been brought in to quell the violence in these situations.</p>
<p>Since October 17, 2019, Lebanon has witnessed frequent demonstrations by protesters seeking changes in government. While most protests have been peaceful, a few have involved violence. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests.

<p><b>Border with Syria &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Since August 2014, deadly terror attacks have occurred in border towns along Lebanon&#8217;s border with Syria, as have episodic clashes between the Lebanese Army and Syrian-based violent extremist groups. A 2017 Lebanese Army offensive expelled ISIS militants from territory along Lebanon&#8217;s border with Syria. The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to Beirut.</p>

<p><b>Border with Israel &#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>There have been sporadic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel in connection with the violence between Israel and Hizballah: the last reported incident was in 2014. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid this border area.</p>

<p>Do not travel to Iran due to&nbsp;COVID-19,&nbsp;the risk of&nbsp;kidnapping,&nbsp;and the arbitrary&nbsp;arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19 page</a>&#8239;before&#8239;you plan any international travel.&#8239;&#8239;</p>

<p>Country Summary:&nbsp;U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran have been kidnapped, arrested, and detained on spurious charges. Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans--including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics--on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. citizens and consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian citizens.</p>
<p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran.</p>
<p>Due to the risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Iran, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Do Not Travel To:</p>
<ul>
<li>Areas designated as off limits by the Mauritanian military due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crimes, such as mugging, armed robbery, and assault, are common. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crimes.</p>
<p>Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting places frequented by Westerners.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Mauritania as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside Nouakchott. U.S. government employees may travel only during daylight hours and are prohibited from walking alone outside of designated areas and times.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Areas Designated Off-Limits by the Mauritanian Military&nbsp;&#8211; Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These &#8220;No Movement Zones&#8221; are extremely dangerous due to their proximity to Mali, where armed groups engaged in an active insurgency carry out cross-border attacks into Mauritania. The government of Mauritania does not maintain a substantial presence in these areas and thus police are unable to respond to most incidents there. In addition, cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places. Since the boundaries of such areas frequently change, U.S. citizens should pay attention to all posted signs and notices of restricted entry. They should presume the following areas are off-limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer</li>
<li>All areas east of 08&#8304; longitude (West of Greenwich) situated within 100km of the Mali Border</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC)&nbsp;has issued a&nbsp;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&nbsp;for&nbsp;Guinea due to COVID-19. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Guinea has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders) and business operations (including day cares and schools). Other improved conditions have been reported within Guinea. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://gn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID-19 in Guinea.</p>
<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country and are often sporadic and unplanned, making it difficult to predict the size, route, or level of violence or congestion that may occur.</p>
<p>Any demonstration may turn violent, resulting in injuries and even fatalities. Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents.</p>

Avoid travel to Niger&#8217;s border regions, particularly the Malian border area, Diffa region, and the Lake Chad region. Mali-based extremist groups have crossed the border and conducted multiple lethal attacks on Nigerien security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, Niamey, due to security concerns. Outside of Niamey, all U.S. Embassy personnel are required to travel only during daylight hours and in a minimum of a two-vehicle convoy accompanied by armed Nigerien government security escorts.&nbsp;</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Libya due to&nbsp;<b>COVID-19,&nbsp;crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p>Read&#8239;the Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19&#8239;page</a>&#8239;before&#8239;you&#8239;plan any international&#8239;travel.&#8239;</p>
<p>The&#8239;Centers for Disease Control&#8239;and Prevention&#8239;(CDC)&#8239;has issued a&#8239;Level 4 Travel Health Notice&#8239;for&#8239;Libya&nbsp;due to COVID-19.&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;</p>
<p>Visit the Embassy's&nbsp;<a href="https://ly.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for more information on COVID-19&nbsp;in Libya.&#8239;</p>
<p>Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. Westerners and U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Libya. Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials&nbsp;and&nbsp;citizens. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and&nbsp;&nbsp;government facilities.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as&nbsp;Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, Sabha, and&nbsp;Dernah, have witnessed fighting among armed groups, as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels and airports frequented by Westerners have been&nbsp;the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p>
<p>Militia&nbsp;or armed&nbsp;groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or&nbsp;a&nbsp;legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p>
<p>Some international and national airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. The U.S. government is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya and prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to South Africa due to <b>COVID-19</b>. Exercise increased caution in South Africa due to <b>crime, civil unrest, health,</b> <b>and drought</b>.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html">COVID-19</a> page&nbsp;before&nbsp;you plan any international travel. &nbsp;</p>

<p>South Africa has lifted stay at home orders, and resumed most transportation options and business operations, but most gatherings remain prohibited under the country&#8217;s current lockdown restrictions. Visit the Embassy's <a href="https://za.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-2/">COVID-19 page</a> for more information on COVID<b>-</b>19 in South Africa.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, rape, carjacking, mugging, and &quot;smash-and-grab&quot; attacks on vehicles, is common. There is a higher risk of violent crime in the central business districts of major cities after dark.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent.</p>
<p>South Africa&#8217;s Western, Eastern, and Northern Cape Provinces are experiencing a severe drought. Water supplies in some areas may be affected. Residential water-use restrictions are in place in Cape Town and other municipalities.</p>
